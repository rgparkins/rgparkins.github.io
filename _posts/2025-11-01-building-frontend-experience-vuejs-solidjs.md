## 👋 Why We’re Doing This

One of the fun parts of leading a technical consultancy is finding ways for the team to **learn new tech together** — not just in theory, but in real projects that stretch us.

Lately, we’ve been seeing growing interest in two modern front-end frameworks:

- **Vue.js** – mature, elegant, easy to onboard  
- **Solid.js** – lightweight, reactive, and performance-obsessed

Both have strong communities and feel like smart options for modern public-sector digital delivery — especially when we want clean, maintainable UI work without the full React overhead.

So, this quarter, we’re kicking off a small internal challenge:  
**“Two frameworks, one goal — build something useful while learning together.”**

---

## 🎯 What We Want to Achieve

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Skill growth** | Everyone in the team gets practical experience building with Vue and Solid. |
| **Reusability** | We identify what patterns and tools translate well into our production work. |
| **Confidence** | Our developers and consultants can talk credibly about trade-offs and implementation. |
| **Collaboration** | Create space for mixed-discipline learning — devs, architects, and designers together. |

## 🧩 How We’ll Run It

We’re setting aside one focused day to explore two modern front-end frameworks — Vue.js and Solid.js — side by side.

The team will split into two small groups:

🟢 Team Vue – builds a simple feature using Vue.js.

🔵 Team Solid – recreates the same feature using Solid.js.

The goal isn’t to produce polished apps; it’s to see how each framework feels in practice. By the end of the day, we’ll regroup to compare:

Ease of setup and developer experience.

Readability and maintainability of the code.

How the frameworks fit with our current front-end stack and design system.

We’ll wrap up with a short demo and discussion to capture what worked well, what surprised us, and what we’d do differently if we used either framework in a client project.

## 🧠 What We’ll Measure

| Metric | How we’ll look at it |
|--------|----------------------|
| Setup time | How fast can a dev go from zero to “Hello World”? |
| DX (developer experience) | Was the documentation and tooling intuitive? |
| Reusability | Could we use it in a client-facing project? |
| Performance | Bundle size, load speed, reactivity, accessibility. |

## 🧰 Getting Started

### For Vue.js
```bash
npm init vue@latest
cd my-vue-app
npm install
npm run dev
````

### For Solid.js

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts my-solid-app
cd my-solid-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Shared resources

* [Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
* [Solid.js docs](https://www.solidjs.com/guides/getting-started)
* [Vite build tool](https://vitejs.dev/) – fast bundling for both frameworks
* [Gov.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) – accessible components to integrate

## 💬 After the Sprint

Once both teams have presented:

1. We’ll write up a short comparison — pros, cons, and fit for our projects.
2. We’ll publish a follow-up blog: *“What We Learned Trying Vue and Solid in Public-Sector Projects.”*
3. We’ll keep whichever framework we prefer in our internal “approved tech” list.

## 🧩 Next Steps

| Task                                       | Owner           | Due    |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------ |
| Spin up private GitHub repos for each team | @RichardParkins | ✅      |
| Pick project theme                         | @TechLeads      | [Date] |
| Schedule sprint demos                      | @DeliveryMgr    | [Date] |
| Collect retrospective notes                | All             | [Date] |

## 🚀 Final Thought

This isn’t just about frameworks — it’s about **learning in public, as a team**.
By exploring both Vue and Solid, we’ll stay sharp, broaden our perspectives, and make better tech choices for our clients.

If you want to join a sprint team or just watch the demos, drop a message in the `#frontend-explorers` channel — the more perspectives, the better.
